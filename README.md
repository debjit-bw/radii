Radii (**Recursive Ad Incentivise Interaction**) is a fully decentralized, on-chain advertising platform designed to incentivize all participantsâ€”**Advertisers**, **Partners**, and **Users**. The platform leverages users' on-chain data to display targeted ads on websites and blogs, ensuring equitable ad revenue distribution. It is akin to Google AdSense but operates entirely on blockchain technology, providing transparency, decentralization, and fairness.  

## How It Works  

Radii connects advertisers, publishers, and users in a seamless decentralized ecosystem:  
1. **Advertisers** upload their ads, paying a fee to the Radii platform.  
2. **Partners/Publishers** showcase these ads on their websites or blogs.  
3. **Users** interact with ads and receive incentives for their participation.

Revenue from advertisements is distributed among:  
- **Partners** for hosting ads.  
- **Users** for engaging with ads.  
- **The Radii platform** for operational and development costs.  

## Dashboard Features  

The Radii platform offers three dashboards tailored for different stakeholders:  

### 1. **Advertisers**  
- **Create and Manage Campaigns**: Upload ad content and define target audience parameters.  
- **Analytics Dashboard**: View detailed performance metrics (click-through rates, impressions, audience engagement).  
- **Budget Management**: Monitor and adjust campaign budgets.  

### 2. **Partners/Publishers**  
- **Ad Integration**: Simple tools to embed ads on websites or blogs.  
- **Revenue Analytics**: Real-time tracking of earnings from ad hosting.  
- **Content Customization**: Select ad categories to match site content.  

### 3. **Users**  
- **Interaction Rewards**: Track points or tokens earned by interacting with ads.  
- **Redemption Options**: Redeem tokens for stablecoins or vouchers from partner stores.  
- **Privacy Controls**: Manage data-sharing preferences.  

## Incentivization Model  

Radii ensures transparent and equitable distribution of ad revenue:  
- **Partners**: Earn a share of ad revenue for hosting ads on their platforms.  
- **Users**: Receive rewards (tokens) for engaging with ads.  
- **Advertisers**: Gain insights into ad performance and reach a decentralized audience.
